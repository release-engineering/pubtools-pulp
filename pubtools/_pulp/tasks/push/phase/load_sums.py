    """Phase for loading/calculating checksums of push items.

    Push items may be initially discovered either with checksum information
    (e.g. from Errata Tool) or without (e.g. files in a staging directory).

    In cases where a push item checksum is currently unknown, this phase
    will read the push item's file in order to calculate it. This is handled
    by a dedicated phase since it can be very slow for large content accessed
    via NFS.

    Input queue:
    - items which may or may not have checksum info.

    Output queue:
    - items which have checksums (where the push item type supports that).

    Side-effects:
    - sends updated item states to the Collect phase as soon as checksums
      are known.
